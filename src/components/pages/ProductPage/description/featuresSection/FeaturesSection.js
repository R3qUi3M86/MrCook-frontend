                        come especially handy when you would like to mix some ingredients in MrCook (or knead some dough). Outer surface is silky smooth for
                        aesthetic eye pleasure. The inner surface is very smooth and shiny. This is done specifically to avoid food sticking and make cleaning 
                        as easy as it would be with ordinary plate.

                        of MrCook temperature limits as well as other informative pictograms - be careful with open flame and sharp knives. Butter knives are allright! :)</p>
