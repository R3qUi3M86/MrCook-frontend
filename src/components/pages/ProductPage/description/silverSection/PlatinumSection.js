                        impression. It has been created with extreme precision and attention to details. Main wing and slot shape are formed
                        in such way so that it will not open itself unwantingly. It's varying thickness and curvature is result of extensive research and
                        computer simulations so that it maintains its bowl shape when you need it and doesn't flex too much so you can eat a soup from it.
                        On the other hand, it's flexibility allows you to easily drain it's contents if you need to (for example excess fat 
                        residue after baking).</p>
